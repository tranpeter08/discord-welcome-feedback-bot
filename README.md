This is a rough MVP of a Discord bot that gets feedback from new users that join a server and records it.

Requires a `.env` file.

Create a `.env` file and make sure it has the following content:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<the_discord_bot_token>
```

# Installation Instructions
1. Have Node.js installed
2. Clone this repo
3. In command line, enter `npm i` to install dependencies
4. To start the server, enter `npm start` in terminal
5. If you want to see the records so far, in browser, go to `localhost:3000/feedback`;
